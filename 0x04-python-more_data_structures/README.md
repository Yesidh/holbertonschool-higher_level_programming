## Prerequisites
8 lecture hours about data structues, set and dictionary in phyton              
## Installing

for have the code in your local machine you only need download the code files and put it into a directory.
## Built With

All the code was write under ubuntu 14.04 using the compiler version            
python 3.4 and pep8
