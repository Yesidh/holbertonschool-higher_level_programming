# Python script that takes in a URL and an email address, sends a POST
#  request to the passed URL with the email as a parameter, and finally
#  displays the body of the response.
#     The email must be sent in the variable email
#     You must use the packages requests and sys
#     You are not allowed to import packages other than requests and sys
#     You donâ€™t need to error check arguments passed to the script
#       (number or type)
