- Return a tupe with the lenght of a stirng and its first character:

## Prerequisites
8 lecture hours about list and tuples in phyton                                 
## Installing

for have the code in your local machine you only need download the code files and put it into a directory.
## Built With

All the code was write under ubuntu 14.04 using the compiler version            
python 3.4 and pep8

| ------------------------| ---------------------------------------- |
| **0-print_list_integer.py** | Function that prints all integers of a list, not allowed to use modules, cast integers|
| **1-element_at.py** | Function that retrieves an element from a list|
| **2-replace_in_list.py** | Function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position, if index in negative or gratter than the list return the original list|
| **3-print_reversed_list_integer.py** | Function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order. No allowed to import module and to cast integers into strings|
| **4-new_in_list.py** | Function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list, if index is negative or out of range in the list return the original list, not allowed to use try/except|
| **5-no_c.py** | Function that removes all characters c and C from a string, not allowed to import module an use str.replace()|
| **6-print_matrix_integer.py** | Function that prints a matrix of integers. Not allowed to import any module and cast integers into strings|
| **7-add_tuple.py** | Function that add two tuples. Not allowed to import any modules, the two tuples only contain integers, if a tuple is smaller tah 2 use the value 0 for each missing integer, if a tuple is bigger than 2 use only the first two integers|
| **8-multiple_returns.py** | Function that returns a tuple with the lenght of a string and its first character. if the sentence is empty, the first character should be equal to None. Not allowed to import any module|
| **9-max_integer.py** | Function that finds the biggest integer of a list. If the list is empty return None. Not allowed to import modules and use the builtin max()|
| **10-divisible_by_2.py** | Function that finds all multiplies of 2 in a list. Return a new list with True or False depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2 and the same size as the original list. Not allowed to import module|
| **11-delete_at.py** | Function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list, if index is negative or out the range nothing change. Not allowed to use pop() or import modules|
| **12-swithc.py** | Function that swap values between a and b, max code line 5|
| **13-is_palindrome.c** | Function that returns if a singly linked list is palindrome. return 0 is not palindrome, 1 is palindrome, an empty list is considered palindrome|
| **lists.h** | Header files with prototypes for the 13-is-palindrome|
