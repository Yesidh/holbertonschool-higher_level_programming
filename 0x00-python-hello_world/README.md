# Python - Hello, World
First step in Python:                                                          
Python scripts
Manipulatin strings and integers in python
Linked list in C(a nice exercice)
Some about asembler/Python                                                      
## Examples

str = "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming\      
 language that combines remarkable power with very clear syntax"                
only print this:                                                                
object-oriented programming with Python                                         
                                                                                
you can see the solution in the file 8-cooncat_edges.py                         

## Prerequisites
8 lecture hours about variables in phyton                                       
## Installing

for have the code in your local machine you only need download the code files and put it into a directory.
## Built With

All the code was write under ubuntu 14.04 using the compiler version            
python 3.4 and pep8
